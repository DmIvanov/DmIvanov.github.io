Hi, I’m Dmitrii, the Russian guy who lives and works in Amsterdam. On my day job I mostly do iOS development, but I also like to investigate some new realms. I’ve been designing and implementing dating services, developing health care app, working on tourist guide and e-commerce apps, integrating external bluetooth devices. Currently I work at [ING Group](https://www.ing.com/Home.htm) where I help to develop modern banking app which strives to make banking as easy for the clients as possible (more about my career in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivanovdmitrii/)). After work I spend time with my beloved family or having a glass of wonderful Dutch or Belgian beer in some cosy bar.
