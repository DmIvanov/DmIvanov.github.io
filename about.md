Hi there, I’m Dmitrii, a guy who lives and works in Amsterdam. On my day job I mostly do iOS development, but sometimes also struggling with CI, improving automation tests or investigationg some new realms (other languages or new approaches). I’ve been designing and implementing dating services, developing health care app, working on tourist guide and e-commerce apps, integrating external bluetooth devices. Currently I work at [ING Group](https://www.ing.com/Home.htm) where I help to develop modern banking app which strives to make banking as easy for the clients as possible. After work I usually spend time with my beloved family, doing some sport (jogging, bouldering, squash, padel), playing board games or hanging out over a glass of beer with my friends.
